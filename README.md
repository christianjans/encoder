# encoder
A simple iOS app that encodes and decodes text using keys.

This app is currently not on the iOS App Store, however you can see the images below!

NOTE: Ignore the time on the screenshots (I took the screenshots out of order).

## overview

Below is the Launch Screen for the app!

Enter some text to encode:

Enter a key and press encode!

There are also some settings that you can alter to change some stuff by pressing the gear button at the top right:

For example, toggling the noise and hex encoding does this:

Also, because the settings "Save Keys" was on, the key "The Key." was saved!

(view the keys by pressing the key icon at the top left when the cursor is in the key text field)

Once you are ready to decode some text, place the text to decode in the top text field, enter the key used to encode the text, and press decode!

(as an example, the text to decode is the same as the encoded text)

Finally, you are able to share or save the encoded/decoded text by pressing the arrow on the top left!

(the cursor can't be in the keys text field or there'll be a key icon instead of the arrow icon)
